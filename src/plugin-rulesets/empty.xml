  <description>
    The Empty Code Ruleset contains rules that find empty statements of any
    kind (empty method, empty block statement, empty try or catch block,...).
    This version of the ruleset includes alternate messages from the main PMD
    rulesets/java/empty.xml ruleset.

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyCatchBlock"
    message="The body of this catch block is empty, so the caught
    exception will be thrown away with no action.  If this is what
    you intend, please provide an appropriate comment inside the
    braces.">
    <properties>
        <property name="allowCommentedBlocks" value="true"/>
    </properties>
  </rule>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyIfStmt"
    message="The body of this if statement is empty. Make sure you do
    not have a ; following the if by mistake.  Otherwise, there is
    probably a more efficient way to write the code."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyWhileStmt"
    message="The body of this while loop is empty. Make sure you do
    not have a semicolon (;) after the while by mistake.  If you do
    not need to do anything in the body of the loop you can probably
    omit the loop entirely."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyTryBlock"
    message="The body of this try block is empty, so the entire
    try/catch does nothing.  Add statements to the block or remove it
    entirely."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyFinallyBlock"
    message="The body of this finally block is empty.  Add statements
    to the block or remove it entirely."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptySwitchStatements"
    message="This switch statement is empty.  Add cases with statements
    or remove the switch entirely."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptySynchronizedBlock"
    message="This synchronized block is empty.  Add statements to the
    block or remove it entirely."/>

  <!-- Checkstyle handles this, since it also flags loop usage
  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyStatementNotInLoop"
    message="A semicolon (;) on its own line or extra semicolons at
    the end of a line represent empty statements. Empty statements are
    unnecessary and should be removed."/>
  -->

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyInitializer"
    message="This initializer block is empty.  Add statements
    to the block or remove it entirely."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyStatementBlock"
    message="This block is empty.  Add statements to the
    block or remove it entirely."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/java/empty.xml/EmptyStaticInitializer"

    to the block or remove it entirely."/>
